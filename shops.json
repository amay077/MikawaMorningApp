      "abstract": "Touchscreens are everywhere now (even the desktop!) and this workshop with designer Josh Clark (author of \"Designing for Touch\") tells you what you need to know to make the most of them. Fingers and thumbs turn desktop design conventions on their head and the ergonomics of handheld devices demanding entirely new design patterns for both web and apps. It's no longer just how your pixels look, but also how they feel. This in-depth seminar takes a hands-on approach to touchscreen design with practical guidelines, rich examples, exercises, and new rules that bust \"settled\" conventions.",
